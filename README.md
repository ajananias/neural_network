DIY Neural Network from "Make Your Own Neural Network" by Tariq Rashid.

In this notebook I built a neural network which, when trained on the MNIST dataset, became capable to receive external images of handwritten digits and recognize them based on the image data.

I compared it to my own handwriting and recognized 6 of the 10 digits I provided. On the test data subset of the MNIST dataset the highest performance obtained was 0.9738.
